# FloodAlert

A system for flooding succeptability based on satellite precipitation and soil moisture data. The system has two components:
- Backend: Orchestration of data pipeline for data acquisition, processing and ingestion to Google Cloud Apache Server for data publishing
- Frontend: Data visualization and map for the flood index for interactive visualizations in global scale. 

The project initiated during UIHackathon at the University of Iowa druing my PhD studies. The domain for the project is floodalert.tech which is down because of low resources for Google Cloud Platform.
